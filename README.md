# Shannon Pixel Modem Tweaks

This is a Jetpack Compose Android app written in Kotlin to provide a user-friendly interface for applying modem tweaks to rooted devices for network testing.

This app allows the application of nvitem tweaks from my [Shannon nvitem enabler scripts repository](https://github.com/davwheat/shannon-pixel-modem-nvitem-enabler-scripts).
